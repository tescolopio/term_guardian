# Term_Guardian

This README and the code is currently a WIP. None of the links below are currently working and codebase is in its beginning stages.
Term_Guardian is a web browser extension designed to empower users by demystifying the complex language often found in Terms of Service (ToS) agreements. It automatically detects ToS text on websites, grades its readability, summarizes its content into plain language, and assesses the rights retained or surrendered.

## Features

Term_Guardian comes in two flavors: a **Free Version** and a **Premium Version**.

### Free Version Features

- **ToS Detection**: Automatically detects when you're viewing a Terms of Service agreement.
- **Summary Generation**: Provides a concise summary of the ToS in plain language.
- **Readability Grade**: Grades the ToS text for language complexity using one readability algorithm (Flesch-Kincaid Readability).

### Premium Version Features

- **All Free Version Features**: Includes everything in the Free Version.
- **Enhanced Readability Grading**: Utilizes additional algorithms (Dale-Chall Readability and Gunning Fog Index) for a more comprehensive language difficulty assessment.
- **Rights Retention Grade**: Grades the ToS based on how much freedom or rights are retained or taken, using a sophisticated TensorFlow.js language model.
- **Uncommon Word Definitions**: Provides definitions for uncommon words or excerpts that significantly contribute to the grades.
