# Checklist for Testing

## Step-by-Step Guide to Create Tests for Chrome Extension

### Step 1: Set Up the Testing Environment
- [ ] **Choose a Testing Framework**:
   - [ ] Verify that Jest is installed and configured properly.
   - [ ] Ensure that Jest can execute in a browser-like environment using `jsdom`.
   - [ ] Confirm that all Jest dependencies and plugins are updated and compatible.
- [ ] **Mock Global Objects**:
   - [ ] Set up and validate mocks for `chrome.runtime` methods.
   - [ ] Create mocks for browser-specific objects like `window` and `document`.
   - [ ] Test the behavior of mocked APIs to ensure they behave as expected under test conditions.
- [ ] **Create Sample HTML Pages**:
   - [ ] Design HTML pages with embedded user agreement keywords for testing.
   - [ ] Develop HTML pages without agreement keywords to test negative cases.
   - [ ] Load these HTML pages into the testing environment to ensure DOM manipulations work as expected.

### Step 2: Write Unit Tests for `contentScript.js`
- [ ] **`isUserAgreement` Function**:
   - [ ] Test to confirm detection of multiple user agreement keywords.
   - [ ] Validate that non-agreement texts are correctly identified (negative cases).
   - [ ] Check for false positives where similar but non-agreement terms are present.
- [ ] **`sendTextForAnalysis` Function**:
   - [ ] Simulate successful text transmission and verify message structure and content.
   - [ ] Test error handling when `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` encounters failures.
   - [ ] Ensure that function responses appropriately to `chrome.runtime.lastError`.
- [ ] **`createResultsOverlay` Function**:
   - [ ] Test the creation and correct setting of all attributes and innerHTML content.
   - [ ] Verify that the overlay is properly appended to the DOM.
   - [ ] Ensure overlay removal works correctly through interaction with close button.
- [ ] **Event Listeners**:
   - [ ] Simulate `selectionchange` events and test if the context menu toggles appropriately.
   - [ ] Check message listener integration for correctly handling `displayAnalysisResults`.
   - [ ] Validate that event listeners are correctly removed or deactivated under certain conditions.

### Step 3: Write Unit Tests for `background.js`
- [ ] **`ModelHandler` Class**:
   - [ ] Ensure the model loads successfully from a given URL.
   - [ ] Test error handling when model loading fails.
   - [ ] Validate that an unloaded model prevents text analysis.
- [ ] **Readability Functions**:
   - [ ] Test each readability calculation with precise input and expected output.
   - [ ] Confirm that extreme values (very high and very low) are handled correctly.
   - [ ] Check integration of readability scores into overall grading logic.
- [ ] **Integration Tests for Message Handling**:
   - [ ] Confirm proper reception of analysis requests via messages.
   - [ ] Ensure that responses to analysis requests contain correct data or error messages.
   - [ ] Test asynchronous message handling to confirm that responses are not blocking.

### Step 4: Integration Testing
- [ ] **End-to-End Workflow**:
   - [ ] Test from initiation in content script through to response from background script.
   - [ ] Ensure correct data flow and processing across different parts of the extension.
   - [ ] Validate handling of errors at any point in the workflow.

### Step 5: Testing with Realistic Data
- [ ] **Use the sample HTML files**:
   - [ ] Confirm correct text extraction from HTML.
   - [ ] Validate that the extension behaves correctly with realistic data inputs.
   - [ ] Ensure the UI responds appropriately to data-driven interactions.

### Step 6: Continuous Integration Setup
- [ ] **Set up a CI/CD pipeline**:
   - [ ] Integrate the test suite with GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
   - [ ] Ensure that tests run automatically on push or pull requests.
   - [ ] Confirm that the CI environment matches the production environment closely.

### Step 7: Documentation and Maintenance
- [ ] **Document the testing procedures and findings**:
   - [ ] Ensure that all test cases and their purposes are clearly documented.
   - [ ] Provide guidelines for running and interpreting test results.
   - [ ] Update documentation with changes or additions to the test suite.
- [ ] **Review and update tests regularly**:
   - [ ] Periodically review test coverage to ensure it matches current features.
   - [ ] Refactor tests as needed when code changes.
   - [ ] Add new tests for newly introduced features or identified issues.
