## Step-by-Step Guide to Create Tests for Chrome Extension

### Step 1: Set Up the Testing Environment
1. **Choose a Testing Framework**:
   - Ensure Jest is properly set up for a Chrome extension environment which might include DOM elements.
2. **Mock Global Objects**:
   - Prepare mocks for `chrome.runtime` methods and other browser-specific objects like `window`, `document`, etc. This can be set up in a global setup file for Jest.
3. **Create Sample HTML Pages**:
   - For testing DOM-related functionalities like `isUserAgreement`, create HTML files that include various cases (with and without user agreement terms) which can be loaded into a testing DOM environment.

### Step 2: Write Unit Tests for `contentScript.js`
1. **`isUserAgreement` Function**:
   - Test with HTML content containing user agreement keywords.
   - Test with HTML content without the keywords to ensure it returns false.
2. **`sendTextForAnalysis` Function**:
   - Test successful sending of text.
   - Simulate and test error handling when `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` fails.
3. **`createResultsOverlay` Function**:
   - Test if the overlay is correctly created and contains the right elements and text.
   - Check if the overlay is appended to the document body correctly.
4. **Event Listeners**:
   - Simulate `selectionchange` events and test if the context menu is enabled/disabled appropriately.
   - Test the message listener for `displayAnalysisResults` to see if it triggers `createResultsOverlay` correctly.

### Step 3: Write Unit Tests for `background.js`
1. **`ModelHandler` Class**:
   - Test the `loadModel` method to ensure it handles the model loading process correctly, including error scenarios.
   - Test the `analyzeText` method for correct text processing and error management.
2. **Readability Functions**:
   - Verify each readability function (`fleschReadingEase`, `fleschKincaidGradeLevel`, `gunningFogIndex`) with known inputs and expected outputs.
3. **Integration Tests for Message Handling**:
   - Test the integration of `analyzeText` with message reception in `chrome.runtime.onMessage`.
   - Test response sending and error handling within the message listeners.

### Step 4: Integration Testing
1. **End-to-End Workflow**:
   - Simulate a complete flow from text selection in the content script, message passing to the background script, text analysis, and finally displaying results.
   - Use mocked responses from the TensorFlow model to validate the integration.

### Step 5: Testing with Realistic Data
1. **Use the sample HTML files** to load into your test environment and simulate user interactions like text selection.
2. **Verify that the extension behaves as expected** when these HTML files are used, ensuring that the real-world functionality is correctly simulated.

### Step 6: Continuous Integration Setup
1. **Set up a CI/CD pipeline** (using tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins) to run tests automatically on each commit or pull request to ensure code quality and functionality before any deployment or merges.

### Step 7: Documentation and Maintenance
1. **Document the testing procedures and findings** to ensure that future modifications or extensions of the testing suite can be done easily.
2. **Review and update tests regularly** as new features are added or existing functionalities are changed in the extension.
